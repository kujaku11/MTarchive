### Processing steps
[processing]
step_01 = Time-series electric and magnetic field data were collected using wideband magnetotelluric instrumentation at each site location. These data are provided in ASCII format (*.asc files) for all stations.
date_01 = 2014-07-24


step_02 = Fourier spectra were calculated for windowed time-series data (*.asc files) and used to calculate cross- and auto-power spectra. Impedance and tipper transfer functions (see *.edi files) were calculated at each station. System and sensor responses (antenna.cal file) were deconvolved during this process. By this process, transfer function estimates were made for particular frequency bandwidths for each data run (4096 and 256 Hz sampling frequencies).
date_02 = 2016-01-01

step_03 = The transfer function estimates provided in the *.edi files and displayed in the *.png filea were constructed by selecting optimal TF estimates at each period from a suite of data runs. High (4096 Hz sampling rate) and low (256 Hz sampling rate) frequency wideband recordings provided TF estimates for 1000-1 Hz and 0.001-1 Hz, respectively. So-called optimal TFs were selected based on examination of phase slope, smooth curve assumptions, and operator discretion.
date_03 = 2016-01-01

### Supplemental information that the user should know 
supplement_info = This data product contains magnetotelluric (MT) transfer functions (TFs), which define the frequency dependent linear relations between components of electromagnetic (EM) field variations measured at a single site. Two types of TFs are provided for most sites, impedance data relating horizontal electric and magnetic fields, and tipper data, relating vertical and horizontal magnetic fields. All of the TFs provide input data for subsequent MT inversion and interpretation. They are estimated from the raw EM time series by (a) Fourier transforming data in a series of short overlapping time windows, and (b) applying robust regression methods to calculate TFs from the resulting spectral field estimates. For remote reference processing, data from one or more synchronously recording sites are used for more effective signal/noise separation. The supplied TFs are calculated for a range of periods (which may vary, depending on instrumentation and deployment time), as well as estimation error covariances. \nReferences relevant to this release include: Wight, D., 1991, MT/EMAP Data Interchange Standard, The Society of Exploration Geophysicists, accessed January 19, 2021, at  https://www.seg.org/Portals/0/SEG/News%20and%20Resources/Technical%20Standards/seg_mt_emap_1987.pdf. \nThis data release contains MT data for all sites in this collection.

### Accuracy descriptions 
horizontal_accuracy = Spatial locations were determined from hand-held global positioning system (GPS) devices. In general, the GPS units used by field scientists recorded sample locations to within 100 feet (30 meters) of the true location. The locations were verified using a geographic information system (GIS) and digital topographic maps.
                
vertical_accuracy = Elevations were determined from USGS, The National Map, Bulk Point Query Service based on the USGS 3DEP (3D elevation program) 1/3 arc-second layer (10-meter). Vertical accuracy was not assessed for this specific dataset. The overall absolute vertical accuracy of the seamless DEMs within the conterminous United States (2013), expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) of 25,310 reference points, was 1.55 meters (USGS, 2014 - http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141008). The vertical accuracy varies across the U.S. as a result of differences in source DEM quality, terrain relief, land cover, and other factors.\n Gesch, D.B., Oimoen, M.J., and Evans, G.A., 2014, Accuracy assessment of the U.S. Geological Survey National Elevation Dataset, and comparison with other large-area elevation datasets-SRTM and ASTER: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1008, 10 p., https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141008.
